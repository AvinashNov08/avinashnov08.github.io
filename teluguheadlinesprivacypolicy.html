    <h1>Privacy Policy – Telugu Headlines</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Telugu Headlines</strong> Android app (“the app”) developed by Avinash. The app aggregates Telugu news from publicly available RSS feeds.</p>

    <h2>1. No account or login</h2>
    <p>The app does not require you to create an account or sign in. You can use all features without providing any personal identification.</p>

    <h2>2. Data we do not collect</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, or phone number</li>
        <li>Any account or login credentials</li>
        <li>Article content or full text of news stories</li>
        <li>Analytics or tracking that identifies you</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RSS feeds:</strong> The app fetches news headlines and metadata (title, link, source, publish date, image URL when available) from RSS feeds over the internet. This data is displayed in the app and stored temporarily on your device to show the list of headlines. No login or account is required for this.</li>
        <li><strong>Reading articles:</strong> When you open an article, the app opens the publisher’s website inside the app. We do not collect or store the content of the articles you read.</li>
        <li><strong>Favorites and preferences:</strong> If you mark articles as favorites or use search, that information is stored only on your device in the app’s local database. Favorites and search/interest signals are <strong>not</strong> uploaded to any server.</li>
        <li><strong>On-device personalization:</strong> The app may use on-device logic to label articles by region (e.g. Andhra Pradesh / Telangana) and to reorder headlines based on your in-app behavior (e.g. which categories you open). All of this runs only on your device; no personal data is sent to external servers for this.</li>
        <li><strong>App settings:</strong> Settings such as theme (light/dark/system) are stored only on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requests <strong>INTERNET</strong> permission to fetch RSS feeds and to load article pages when you tap a headline. No other sensitive permissions are required for core functionality.</p>

    <h2>5. Third parties</h2>
    <p>When you open an article, you are taken to the publisher’s website. Those sites have their own privacy policies and may collect data according to their terms. We do not control and are not responsible for third-party sites.</p>

    <h2>6. Data storage and retention</h2>
    <p>All data stored by the app (headlines cache, favorites, search keywords, interest counts, theme) is kept only on your device. If you uninstall the app or clear its data, this information is removed. We do not retain copies on our servers.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date below will be revised when changes are made. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or the app, you can contact the developer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Through the Play Store listing for Telugu Headlines, or</li>
        <li>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the app or email us at
        avinash_nov08@hotmail.com</a></li>
    </ul>
